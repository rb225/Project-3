    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="p1"> INFORMATION WILL BE DISPLAYED, FLOATING IN THE AIR....THE WEB WILL APPEAR IN THE REAL WORLD, NOT JUST ON GLASS SCREENS.”
      In the next five decades We believe that computer communications will become completely natural. Like using electricity, you won’t think about it anymore. Access will be totally improved—think thousands of low Earth orbit satellites—and speeds will be higher, with 5G and optical fiber, and billions of networked devices with increased interactive capabilities in voice, gesture, and artificially intelligent systems. We also imagine an expansion of the Interplanetary Internet. But who knows, after everything that has been accomplished in the past 50 years, the only thing we can be certain about is that the possibilities are endless.
      Experts say that this will create improvements in people’s lives and the new challenges – including privacy, digital divides, anti-social behavior and stress tests for how human social and political systems adapt.

      <h2 style="font-size:30px;">An Increasingly Virtual World</h2>
      <p class="p1">  According to our experts, that will come sooner rather than later. Within only the next quarter century, the way we search or use the internet will be considered “archaically clunky,”.
        The world in front of us will be a mix of reality and the virtual and, at times, it will be impossible to decipher which one is which.
        People will subscribe to different augmentations, much as we now subscribe to magazines. Virtual reality used within businesses is forecasted to grow from $829 million in 2018 to $4.26 billion in 2023, according to Artillery Intelligence.
        It is being used for training, work meetings or to provide better customer service during the pandemic.

      <h2 style="font-size:30px;">New Forms of the Communication</h2>
      <p class="p1">  Advancements will adapt to this new era of vocal communications. Earbuds will be replaced by invisible implants that modulate all hearing—sometimes shutting out the surrounding soundscape in favor of the virtual one, sometimes amplifying a single nearby voice; effectively all of one’s hearing will be mediated through these audio implants.
        More accurate results will be delivered, which will make communication faster and require less brainpower. Also, due to ability to mix speech with augmented reality, doors will open that will allow us to understand and communicate with everyone.
        In the near-future, typing messages will go away in favor of verbal and auditory communications, much like what’s already been introduced with Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa
        Small gestures and gaze tracking will provide ways for us to communicate and interact with our environment more dynamically. This would also be the beginning of "neuro-engagement".

      <h2 style="font-size:30px;">A Health Data Revolution</h2>
      <p class="p1">  The very beginning of the bio data revolution is already upon us with the emergence of wearable, constantly connected tech that collects information about our health. There’s an overall belief from the experts we spoke with that this could be a great thing for a society, the ability to actually have reams of data that can be applied to create better health care practices.

        Next generation have a lot more information about how people really eat, exercise, and conduct their daily lives, which will allow doctors and researchers to better tailor programs to serve our needs and help us become healthier.
